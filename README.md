MPI - DBSCAN

A project based on Algorithmic Techniques and Applications of Msc in Artificial Intelligence, University of Piraeus. It is a parallel implementation of DBSCAN algorithm, written in C and using OpenMPI library. 

The original algorithm balongs to Gagarine Yaikhom in "Implementing the DBSCAN clustering algorithm", MIT University.
